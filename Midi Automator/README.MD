MIDI Automator
======

MIDI Automator is a desktop software for automating user actions (i.e. opening files, clicking buttons) 
triggered by midi messages. 

The main idea is to have a little helper for musicians who use laptops on stage. 
Most musicians use Ableton Live for that purpose. But they have to store their songs
in one big live-set file, which is hard to maintain. With MIDI Automator they can prepare and change
an ordered set list out of single live-set files. MIDI Automator can listen to midi messages and
load the next, previous or desired live-set file. All other features of shall support the demand
of a fully automated stage setup.

MIDI Autopmator shall be hold as generic as possible, so that it can also handle other use cases 
that are way apart from the main idea.
